# Best Animation Program

Are you tired of animation programs being too expensive and stuff? Don't you want something free?? Something that's super extensible that you can code to your own needs????!?!?? ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î

*Then you've come to the right place*

Introducing:

**BEST ANIMATION PROGRAM**

cuz it's the best üòéüòçü•∞

# EPIC FEATURES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

* Introducing our innovative PENCIL TOOL!! But what's even more innovative, is that it also functions as an eraser too!
  * By that I mean I was too lazy to add an eraser tool so you just have to color things white instead
  * Also I was too lazy to add an algorithm that would fill in between the gaps, so if you moved the pencil too fast there would be blank spots.
* Tired of how confusing RGB is? 256 values for each color channel is a lot, so we've simplified it so you can maximize your productivity without having to worry about color theory. üòé
  * Now Each color channel has only 3 possible values!!!!!!! You'll never get any beautiful and unique colors again, but we love things simplified here (totally not because I was too lazy to make things complicated).
  * No color wheel at all! You have to modify the RGB values yourself with stupid (I mean innovative) buttons.
* Tired of being overwhelmed by all the frames in an animation timeline??? Don't worry, in BEST ANIMATION PROGRAM, the timeline only shows 6 frames!! ü§Ø We love innovation at the cost of actually making things harder!
  * Why drag and drop frames, when you can just press a button to do it for you? With our beloved *move frame* buttons, we make moving around frames take 10x longer than it should be. üòé
* ONIONSKIN BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AN ONION LETS GOOOOOOOOO (AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO USE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANY RED BLUE TINTING OR WHATEVER)
